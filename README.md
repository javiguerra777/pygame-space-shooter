I used a freecodecamp tutorial to create a space shooters clone.
To run this app use python and run main.py or the built in python runner in VScode.
I was unable to implement sounds, so I commented out the code to use sounds.
I also did not use a background image, but I commented that out as well.
There is a weird glitch when trying to move left while holding the right button and vice verse, I will work to fix that.
But the game runs well, try to have fun, and if you are interested you can clone this repo and build on this template.
